For beginners like me to learn the concepts in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

To run this example:

1. From the repo folder run:  
   `npm install`
 `npm start`
2. open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in the browser

And also head over to http://redux.js.org/ for some great documentation.
